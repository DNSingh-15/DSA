# `Dynamic Programming`


it is technique for Identifying and solving the sub-problems

* Dynamic programming is a problem solving technique that make programs more efficient

 
# (a). Memoization

* Memoization is a technique for improving the performance of recursive algorithms

## `Top-down with Memoization`

* Top-Down breaks the large problem into multiple subproblems. if the subproblem already solved just reuse them. Otherwise, Solve the subproblem and store the result. Top-Down uses memoization to avoid recomputing the same subproblem again.



# (b). Tabulation

* Tabulation is a bottom-up method for solving DP problems.


## `Bottom-up with Tabulation`
* Then, it goes one level up and combines the solutions it previously obtained to construct the optimal solutions to more complex problems. Eventually, tabulation combines the solutions of the original problem's subproblems and finds its optimal solution
